<img  src="Capture.jpg" width="400" height="250" align = "left"/><font color = "green">My dog Sasha is my best friend. She likes to chase<br> 
the soccer ball when I practice.It's so funny to<br>
see her running down the field trying to catch the<br>
ball with her mouth. It just won't fit!<br>

Once Sasha saved my life. When I was only 4 years old, I started to go into the street to get a ball that<br>
had rolled across the street. Of course I didn't think to look for cars! Sasha got in front of me and<br>
knocked me backwards onto the sidewalk. I was so mad until I saw the car go by where I would have been.<br>
Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was!
